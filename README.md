OVERVIEW

A collection of custom collections for use in emulationstation for example, Retropie

Place these in the folder /opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/collections/

This is far from being a complete list. If you have additions please add them

You can create your own and add them to this repository. A useful command line to help you would be:
find /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/ -maxdepth 2 -name '*GAME NAME HERE*' -exec echo {} \;
Remember that this is case sensitive and will not find roms in systems such as arcade
